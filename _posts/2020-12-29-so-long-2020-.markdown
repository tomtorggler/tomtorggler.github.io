True, I had to cancel some trips and I stayed home a lot more than usual, but apart from that, it was a pretty spectacular year. I moved to Amsterdam from a smaller city just outside of it. I went to Marbella, Sardinia, Napoli, and other places. In a prolonged episode of lockdown blues I was even able to do about 1000 km on my road bike. I learned a lot. 

Since a certain global event made traveling impossible, or at least not very recommendable, I stayed in Amsterdam for the holiday season and started building this new site.
