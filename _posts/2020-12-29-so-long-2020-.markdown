# Personal

I moved to Amsterdam in March. Spent most of the rest of the year in my new home office. And this is not complaining. For me 2020 was a good year. I learned a lot. 

Since a certain global event made traveling impossible, or at least not very recommendable, I stayed in Amsterdam and as I had some free time, I started building this new site.

Goodbye ntSystems.it

# Welcome onprem.wtf

This is my new personal website. And blog. And playground.
