excerpt: What a year.
---


True, I had to cancel some trips and I stayed home a lot more than usual, but apart from that, it was a pretty spectacular year for me. I moved to Amsterdam from a smaller city in the outskirts. I was able to go to Zürich, Sardinia, Marbella, Napoli, and other places. In a prolonged episode of lockdown blues I was even able to get about 1000 km on my road bike done. I worked a lot. I learned a lot. 
Since a certain global event made more travelling impossible, or at least not very recommendable, I’m staying in Amsterdam for the holiday season and started building this new site.
After more than 10 years, it’s now time to say: Goodbye ntSystems.it

# Welcome onprem.wtf
This is our new home. For now it’s still build with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages. I replaced the default minima theme with a custom one, mostly because I wanted to learn and experiment with some CSS features.
The new site has a simpler layout, less clutter, and has a dark theme. Actually, unless you select a specific theme on top, it will use the same settings that your operating system (or browser) uses. 
What about the domain name you ask? Well, this one was available and it kind of reflects what we are doing at the moment.
